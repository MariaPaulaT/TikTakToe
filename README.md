# TicTacToe
Get ready for a thrilling game of tic-tac-toe! This website brings the classic game to life with a fun twist. You and a friend can play against each other, with each of you taking turns to place your mark. To start the game, simply press any key and the game will begin! You'll see "It's player 1's turn!" displayed on the screen. You and your opponent will alternate clicks on the buttons until one of you has successfully placed three of your marks in a row, column, or diagonal. If that happens, a celebratory message will pop up on the screen declaring "Player X Wins!" and a celebratory sound effect will play. But if all buttons are filled and there's no winner, don't worry, the game will declare a tie and invite you to play again by pressing a key. Get ready for some fast-paced fun!
